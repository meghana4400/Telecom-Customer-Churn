# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. The dataset is processed to clean missing values, handle categorical variables, and visualize important patterns. Predictive modeling is employed to classify customer churn using machine learning techniques.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and preprocess categorical variables using dummy encoding.
- **Data Visualization**: Explore key patterns in customer churn through plots and graphs.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following:
- **Python 3.8+**
